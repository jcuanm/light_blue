We have implemented a Chess AI that recommends chess moves to a player according to what the configuration of the board looks like using Python. Details about the implementation of the algorithm can be found inside of the "Reports" folder that is inside of the "CS51 Project" folder. Instructions for how to use the algorithm can be found in the OTHER README.md file that is located inside of the "CS51 Project" file. 

The inspiration for comes from the Deep Blue chess AI that was built and implemented.

***Warning*** 
This algorithm does not work on Python version 3x.
