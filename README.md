We have implemented a Chess AI in Python that recommends chess moves according to the configuration of the board. Details about the implementation of the algorithm can be found inside of the "Reports" folder that is inside of the "CS51 Project" folder. Instructions for how to use the algorithm can be found in the OTHER README.md file that is located inside of the "CS51 Project" file. 

The inspiration for comes from the Deep Blue chess AI that was built and implemented. Please visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVTTtx8TDfs to see a video of our project in action.

***Warning*** 
This algorithm does not work on Python version 3x.
